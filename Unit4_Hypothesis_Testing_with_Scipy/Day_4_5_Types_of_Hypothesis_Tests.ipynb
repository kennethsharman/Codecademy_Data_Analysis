    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how about how we can use hypothesis testing to answer these questions. There are several different types of hypothesis tests for the various scenarios you may encounter. Luckily, SciPy has built-in functions that perform all of these tests for us, normally using just one line of code.\n",

    "Let's imagine the fictional business BuyPie, which sends ingredients for pies to your household, so that you can make them from scratch. Suppose that a product manager wants the average age of visitors to BuyPie.com to be 30. In the past hour, the website had 100 visitors and the average age was 31. Are the visitors too old? Or is this just the result of chance and a small sample size?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can test this using a univariate T-test. A univariate T-test compares a sample mean to a hypothetical population mean. It answers the question \"What is the probability that the sample came from a distribution with the desired mean?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When we conduct a hypothesis test, we want to first create a null hypothesis, which is a prediction that there is no significant difference. The null hypothesis that this test examines can be phrased as such: \"The set of samples belongs to a population with the target mean\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the 1 Sample T Test is a p-value, which will tell us whether or not we can reject this null hypothesis. Generally, if we receive a p-value of less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and state that there is a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy has a function called ttest_1samp, which performs a 1 Sample T-Test for you.\n",

    "For ANOVA and 2-Sample T-Tests, using datasets with standard deviations that are significantly different from each other will often obscure the differences in group means.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for similarity between the standard deviations, it is normally sufficient to divide the two standard deviations and see if the ratio is \"close enough\" to 1. \"Close enough\" may differ in different contexts but generally staying within 10% should suffice.\n",

    "3. THE SAMPLES MUST BE INDEPENDENT\n",
    "When comparing two or more datasets, the values in one distribution should not affect the values in another distribution. In other words, knowing more about one distribution should not give you any information about any other distribution.\n",

    "Here are some examples where it would seem the samples are not independent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    the number of goals scored per soccer player before, during, and after undergoing a rigorous training regimen\n",
    "    a group of patients' blood pressure levels before, during, and after the administration of a drug\n",
    "It is important to understand your datasets before you begin conducting hypothesis tests on it so that you know you are choosing the right test.\n",
