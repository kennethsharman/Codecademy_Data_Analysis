    "### Introduction to Sample Size and A/B Testing\n",
    "One of the first steps to designing a successful experiment is determining the number of samples that you need in order to have confidence in the results. We don’t want to go through the trouble of running an A/B test or administering a survey only to discover that we don’t have enough information to make a good decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we asked 5 people who they were voting for in an election, that small sample size would not be sufficient to predict the election results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we’ll cover two common types of experiment and their methods of sample size determination:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A/B Tests\n",
    "    Surveys\n",
    "Online sample size calculators are available for both of these scenarios. These calculators will require quantities like “baseline conversion rate” or “population size”, but it’s not always obvious what these should be for a specific experiment. We’ll be covering that and more in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A/B Testing: Using a Calculator\n",
    "An A/B Test is a scientific method of choosing between two options (Option A and Option B). Some examples of A/B tests would include:\n",
    "\n",
    "What number of sale items on a website makes customers most likely to purchase something: 25 or 50?\n",
    "What color button are customers more likely to click on: blue or green?\n",
    "In order to determine the sample size necessary for an A/B test, a sample size calculator requires three numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Baseline conversion rate\n",
    "    The Minimum detectable effect\n",
    "    The Statistical significance\n",
    "We've included an A/B testing sample size calculator in the workspace. Can you find out what the sample size would be to detect at least a 30% increase from a 20% baseline with 90% statistical significance? Save the results in the variable called sample_size."

    "A/B tests compare an option that we’re currently using to a new option that we suspect might be better. In order to compare the two options, we need a metric. Generally, our metric will be the percent of users who take a certain action after interacting with one of our options. For instance:\n",

    "    The percent of users who click on one of two versions of an ad\n",
    "    The percent of readers who open an email with one of two subject lines\n",
    "In order to calculate the sample size for our A/B test, we need to know whether we expect our metric to be low or high. It will take more samples to be able to spot a difference when our metric is extremely low or extremely high. Our initial estimate of our metric is called a baseline.\n",

    "### A/B Testing: Don't Interfere With Your Tests\n",
    "Brian the Product Manager has been running an A/B Test for a redesign of Viral Villanelle’s landing page. Brian used the principles in the Sample Size Determination course on Codecademy to calculate a sample size. He needs 1,100 users to view each variant of the landing page in order to be able to detect his desired lift. When he reaches a total of 2,200 visits to both variants, he runs a Chi-Square test. The new website design performs slightly better, but the results are not statistically significant. Brian decides to run the test for another week to see if he can get to significance. He really wants to launch the redesigned website and he needs statistical validation to show to his boss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brian has made a big mistake! By choosing to extend the A/B test past the sample size he needs, he introduces personal bias to the results of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the results had already been significant, he wouldn’t have run the test any longer. If he continues this pattern of preferentially extending the test when he wants a different answer, he will be more likely to get the results he wants, regardless if these desired results reflect reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s sad, but Brian will need to accept that the redesigned website isn’t significantly better than the original website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two important rules for making sure that A/B tests remain unbiased:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Don’t continue to run the test after the predetermined sample size, until \"significant\" results are found.\n",
    "    Don’t stop a test before reaching the predetermined sample size, just because your results reach significance early (unless there are ethical reasons that require you to stop, like a prescription drug trial).\n",
    "Test data is sensitive to changes in sample size, which is why it is important to calculate beforehand.\n",

    "### A/B Testing: Splitting a Test\n",
    "Viral Villanelle's social media presence drives visits to its website. Product Manager Brian wants to test a new ad. Using a sample size calculator, he finds that he will need a sample size of 1,100. Viral Villanelle’s current advertisement is shown to 500 users per day. What’s the best way for Brian to get his desired sample size?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to remember that Brian will need to show both the old and the new ad to 1,100 users each. If Brian wants to get complete this test as quickly as possible, he could randomly divide users into two groups: half of users would see the old ad and half would see the new ad. It would take a little more than 4 days for 2,200 users to see one of the two ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if Brian doesn't want to divide Viral Villanelle's audience evenly? If Brian is running many different types of A/B tests, he might not want to expose users to a barrage of different tests. Maybe only 10% of users should be shown the new ad, in case it performs terribly. By doing this, he would only be getting 50 users per day towards the 1,100 users that need to see the new ad. In this case, he would need to wait for 22 days (1100 / 50 = 22) in order to get his results, even though he would have gotten the 1,100 views for the old ad 3 days into the experiment.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It is easy to find a sample size calculator online, but it is difficult to determine what parameters to input. Generally, sample size calculators use 4 parameters:\n",

    "    Margin of error\n",

    "    Population size\n",
    "    Expected proportion \n",

    "### Population Size\n",
    "Our sample should accurately represent the population as a whole. So, when we are dealing with a larger population, we should probably be sampling more people.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes tricky to determine what the effective population size is. For example, suppose there are 200 people who currently visit BeetsMe regularly. Is 200 the population size for our vegetable survey?\n",
    "\n",
    "If BeetsMe wants to appeal to the tourists that frequently visit Vancucumber, or if they ever want to launch an online store to ship healthy treats all over the world, the real population size is closer to 8 billion (or infinity, really, if we think about the number of humans who could eventually exist and have vegetable preferences). So, for experiments like this, we use the highest population size we can. Normally, 100,000 will suffice, as changes become negligible beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, for decisions that require extrapolation to an unknown customer base, it is important to understand the preferences of a typical person out in the world, whether or not they are part of your customer base right now. Generally, we use this larger population size of 100,000 or greater instead of focusing on the amount of current customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the small town of Vancucumber is holding an election for a new mayor, and we want to project the results of the election, then the 1700 citizens would be the only important people. In this case, 1700 is the population size we would use in a sample size calculator.\n",

    "As the expected proportion of people with the desired trait decreases, we can survey fewer people. For example, if we are projecting election results and Candidate C has 1% of the voter base, taking a small sample of only 5 people might be fine, because it is very likely that no one we have chosen is voting for Candidate C. This is close enough to the true proportion.\n",

For example, if we choose a confidence level of 99%, we can expect that after multiple repetitions of the survey, the true value will lie within our specified range 99% of the time. As we increase the confidence level, we must have a larger sample size.\n",
