    "### Introduction to Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is the basis of a branch of statistics called Bayesian Statistics, where we take prior knowledge into account before calculating new probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn this theorem, we'll need to review independence and conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to solve simple problems involving prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent Events\n",
    "The ability to determine whether two events are independent is an important skill for statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two events are independent, then the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. Here are some examples of independent events:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I wear a blue shirt; my co-worker wears a blue shirt\n",
    "    I take the subway to work; I eat a tuna sandwich for lunch\n",
    "    The NY Giants win their football game; the NY Rangers win their hockey game\n",
    "If two events are dependent, then when one event occurs, the probability of the other event occurring changes in a predictable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of dependent events:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It rains on Tuesday; I carry an umbrella on Tuesday\n",
    "    I eat spaghetti; I have a red stain on my shirt\n",
    "    I wear sunglasses; I go to the beach\n",
    " \n",
    "A certain family plans to have three children. Is the event that the couple's third child is a girl independent of the event that the couple's first two children are girls? Save your answer ('independent' or 'not independent') to the variable third_child."

    "### Conditional Probability\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability that two events happen. It's easiest to calculate conditional probability when the two events are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For the rest of this lesson, we'll be using the statistical convention that the probability of an event is written as P(event).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the probability of Event A is P(A) and the probability of Event B is P(B) and the two events are independent, then the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) $$\n",
    "(The symbol ∩ just means \"and\", so P(A ∩ B) means probability that both A and B happen)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose we are rolling a pair of dice, and want to know the probability of rolling two sixes. Each die has six sides, so the probability of rolling a six is 1/6. Each die is independent (i.e., rolling one six does not increase or decrease our chance of rolling a second six), so\n",

    "### Testing for a Rare Disease\n",
    "Suppose you are a doctor and you need to test if a patient has a certain rare disease. The test is very accurate: it's correct 99% of the time. The disease is very rare: only 1 in 100,000 patients have it.\n",

    "\n",
    "We're able to come to this conclusion because we had more information than just the accuracy of the test; we also knew the prevalence of this disease. That extra information about how we expect the world to work is called a prior.\n",
